# LDB Minimum Viable Project
## Installation
You can install it locally by cloning + pip install -r requirements.txt

You can also get it through pip but this is useless as you want to run it with flask, not python.

Run with flask run while youâ€™re in the tld.



Forget your directories full of random arXiv-numbered PDFs or
cryptically-labeled court documents.
A librarian for research literature. Search, preview, and download articles.
Grep through, annotate, and cite your locally saved documents.
Working title, librarian-database, LaDdBrarian (after one of my teachers), also
a convenient, unused three-character bin command.
## Purpose
Serves as an online repository client and local db which allows users to
find and manage their literature.
## UI
### LDB
`ldb`: universal prefix for all following subcomands, like git.
Alone, it prints a help text. Each subcommand can also be used with a short
letter command
### Search
`(s)earch [OPTS] [TERM]`: starts the online repository client
Searches online repository(ies) for a particular
search term. Options allow selection of repository and  advanced search
for authors, year published, etc. Displays list of articles in curses/tui
interface
#### Opts
* `-a` author
* `-t` title
* `-b` before date
* `-d` after date
#### Interface
* `k` move up on  the article list
* `j` move down on  the article list
* `C-u` move 5 items up
* `C-d` move 5 items down
* `G` move to bottom of list
* `gg` move to top of list
* `1-9` jump to a specific article in the list
* `l` or `Enter` display abstract of selected article in pager
* `f` view full article in pager or pdf viewer
* `s` save article
* `q` quits interactive client
### List
`(l)ist [SORT]`
* `-r` reverse whatever sorting option is chosen
* `(au)thor`: sort alpha by author
* `(ac)cessed`: sort by date accessed/stored
* `(cr)eated`: sort by date article was created
### Grep
`(g)rep [OPTS] [REGEXP]` Prints list of articles whose text match regexp
* Search through text [REGEXP] and metadata
* Opts to specify search field similar to above
* Maybe sorting like above?
### Open
`(o)pen [OPTS] [SEARCH]`
* Similar to grep, but opens the file in a viewer if there is one match
* If more than one match, opens a TUI list with a similar interface as the one
described above
* Maybe multiple selections?
### Cite
`(c)ite [FORMAT] [OPTS] [SEARCH]`
* Prints citations of all literature which matches search queries
* Uses the given format for citations, possible candidates: APA, MLA, BlueBook,
Ap J, IEEE
### Help
`(h)elp [SUBCOMMAND]`
* Prints a help for `ldb` or a help for the given subcommand
## Implementation
* `tui.py`
```python
class TUIItem(ABC):
	"""
	Abstract class for objects displayed on a text user interface.
	"""

	def __init__(self):
		super().__init__()
	
	@abstractmethod
	def title(self):
		"""
		Return a title string of <72 characters
		"""

	@abstractmethod
	def text(self):	
		"""
		Return brief text for the item, 72 chars * 3 lines
		"""


def display(itemlist):
	"""
	Accepts a list of TUIItems and genrates a TUI to navigate between them.
	Implements basic vim-like movement commands. When a non-navigation
	command i received, it does Item.__call__(<key pressed>)
	Arguments:
		itemlist -- list of Item objects to display
	Returns:
		Nothing. Usually the last thing called in in the program
	"""
```
* `ldb.py`
```python
def init(path):
	"""
	creates a new .ldb directory and database in the specified path
	"""
```
* `db.py`
```python
```
* `document.py`
```python
class Document:
	"""
	Stores information about the document
	"""
```
